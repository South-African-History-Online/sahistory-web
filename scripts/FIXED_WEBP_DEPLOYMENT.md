# 🔧 FIXED WebP Auto-Conversion Deployment

## 🎯 **The Fix: Queue-Based Processing**

Instead of processing WebP conversion immediately on upload (which corrupted images), the new system:

1. ✅ **Queues conversion for later processing** (doesn't block upload)
2. ✅ **Waits for file to be fully written** before conversion  
3. ✅ **Uses higher quality** (85% instead of 80%)
4. ✅ **Better error handling** and logging
5. ✅ **Avoids duplicate processing** (only on insert, not update)

## 🚀 **Production Deployment Steps**

### 1. Deploy Fixed Module
```bash
# Copy the entire fixed module to production
scp -r webroot/modules/custom/saho_webp/ user@production:/path/to/drupal/webroot/modules/custom/

# Clear cache to apply changes
vendor/bin/drush cr
```

### 2. Test the Fix
```bash
# Check module status
vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-status

# Process any existing queue items
vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-process-queue --limit=10
```

### 3. Upload Test Image
- Upload a new image through Drupal admin
- Check that it's added to the queue: `vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-status`
- Process the queue: `vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-process-queue`
- Verify WebP file is created correctly

## 📋 **New Commands Available**

### Queue Management
```bash
# Check queue status
vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-status

# Process queue items manually
vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-process-queue --limit=50

# Process all queue items
vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-process-queue
```

### Existing Commands (Still Work)
```bash
# Convert all existing images
vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-convert-all

# Fix double extension files
vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-fix-names
```

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### Old (Broken) Flow:
1. User uploads image → 
2. **Immediate WebP conversion during upload** ❌
3. File corruption/interference

### New (Fixed) Flow:
1. User uploads image → 
2. **Image saved successfully** ✅
3. **Conversion request added to queue** ✅
4. **Queue processes conversion safely later** ✅

## 🎯 **Production Setup Commands**

```bash
# Navigate to Drupal root
cd /home/yourusername/public_html/sahistory.org.za

# Deploy fixed module
# (Upload via FTP/SCP from your dev environment)

# Clear cache
vendor/bin/drush cr

# Check status
vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-status

# Set up cron to process queue automatically
# Add this to your crontab:
# */5 * * * * cd /path/to/drupal && vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-process-queue --limit=20
```

## 🔧 **Cron Integration**

The queue can be processed automatically by cron. Add to your crontab:

```bash
# Process WebP queue every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * cd /home/yourusername/public_html/sahistory.org.za && vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-process-queue --limit=20 >/dev/null 2>&1
```

Or rely on Drupal's built-in cron (the queue worker has `cron = {"time" = 60}` which means it processes during cron runs).

## ✅ **Expected Results**

After deployment:

1. **No more image corruption** on upload
2. **WebP files created reliably** via queue processing
3. **Better error handling** with detailed logs
4. **Higher quality WebP files** (85% quality)
5. **Automatic queue processing** via cron

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

- **Original images are NEVER modified** - only WebP copies are created
- **Queue processing is safe** - runs after upload completes
- **Failed conversions are logged** in Drupal logs
- **Queue items are retried** if they fail initially

## 🎉 **Testing Verification**

After deployment, verify everything works:

1. Upload a test image
2. Check queue: `vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-status`
3. Process queue: `vendor/bin/drush saho:webp-process-queue`
4. Verify WebP file created alongside original
5. Test WebP serving in browser

Your WebP auto-conversion should now work perfectly without corrupting images!
