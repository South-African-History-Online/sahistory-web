/**
 * Page Node Styling
 *
 * NOTE: Basic pages now use the same layout as articles (.saho-article-wrapper, .saho-article-grid)
 * defined in layout/_article-layout.scss for consistency across all content types.
 *
 * This file is kept for any page-specific overrides if needed in the future.

// Currently no page-specific styles needed
// Pages inherit all styling from article layout
