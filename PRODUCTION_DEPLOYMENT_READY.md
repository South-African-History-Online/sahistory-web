## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment (5 minutes)

```bash
# On production server
cd /path/to/sahistory-web

# Backup database (CRITICAL)
drush sql:dump > backups/pre-webp-fix-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup
ls -lh backups/

# Optional: Test restore procedure
# drush sql:cli < backups/pre-webp-fix-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql
```

### 2. Deployment (10 minutes)

```bash
# Pull latest code
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge origin/bugfix/webp-image-path-corrections
# OR
git pull origin bugfix/webp-image-path-corrections

# Verify files updated
git log -3 --oneline

# Run database updates
drush updb -y

# Expected output:
# - Update 11002: Fixed 6132 file_managed URIs
# - Update 11003: Fixed oldsite_images references

# Clear caches
drush cr
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Verify schema updated
drush sqlq "SELECT value FROM key_value WHERE collection='system.schema' AND name='db_fixes'"
# Should return: i:11003;

# 2. Check update logs
drush ws --type=db_fixes --count=5

# 3. Test key pages
curl -I https://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/images_new/BAHA-Mandela-end-Treason_0.webp
# Should return: 200 OK

# 4. Monitor error logs
drush ws --type=page_not_found --count=20
# Should see reduction in WebP 404 errors over next few hours
```

---

## Expected Results

### Immediate (Within 5 minutes)
- Database updates complete successfully
- No errors in logs
- WebP files accessible on updated paths

### Short-term (Within 24 hours)
- Reduction in WebP 404 errors (monitor logs)
- Faster page load times (WebP is 30-70% smaller)
- Better user experience on mobile

### Long-term (Ongoing)
- Sustained improvement in page performance
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Better SEO (page speed is ranking factor)

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

```bash
# Stop: If you see ANY errors during deployment

# 1. Restore database backup
drush sql:cli < backups/pre-webp-fix-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql

# 2. Revert code
git revert 3d2fc6de 4b643966 5f5ac3db 84a9e058 96312dcc --no-commit
git commit -m "Rollback: WebP fix - issue encountered in production"
git push origin main

# 3. Clear caches
drush cr

# 4. Verify restoration
drush ws --type=db_fixes --count=5
```

**Note**: Rollback should only be needed if:
- Database update fails with errors
- Site becomes inaccessible
- Content displays incorrectly

None of these occurred during testing.

---

## Monitoring After Deployment

### First Hour
```bash
# Check error logs every 15 minutes
watch -n 900 "drush ws --type=page_not_found --count=10"
```

### First Day
- Monitor 404 errors for WebP files
- Check Google Analytics for page speed improvements
- Verify no user reports of broken images

### First Week
- Compare WebP 404 counts before/after
- Measure bandwidth savings
- Gather user feedback
