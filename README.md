   ```
2. Install the latest modules and themes:
   ```sh
   ddev composer install
   ```
3. Run the custom DDEV Drupal local update script:
   ```sh
   .ddev/commands/host/local_update
   ```
4. If the project is still broken, restart DDEV:
   ```sh
   ddev restart
   ```
5. If issues persist, try reimporting the database:
   ```sh
   ddev import-db
   ```
6. If the project is still not working, consult the project's tech lead.

### Composer
New functionality is often added through contributed, premium, or custom modules. These are installed and maintained using Composer, which is a dependency manager for PHP. This documentation on [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) will help you get up to speed and manage dependencies efficiently.

**Note:** While developing new features or structures, do not update Composer dependencies unless necessary. Avoid running `composer update` unless it's part of the assigned task.

#### Quick Commands List
- To add a dependency to a project:
  ```sh
  composer require drupal/example_contrib_module
  ```
- To install all dependencies from `composer.json` or `composer.lock`:
  ```sh
  composer install
  ```

Changes to dependencies are written to `composer.json` and `composer.lock` in the root of our project, where they can be committed and pushed remotely.

### Drupal Configuration During Development
While developing a new feature or structure in Drupal, it's important to export the configuration of the feature you're working on. You can always check the status of the configuration synchronization using Drush:
   ```sh
   drush config:status
   ```
If you have changes to the configuration, use Drush to export these:
   ```sh
   drush cex -y
   ```
The configuration will be written to `.yml` files in `/config/sync`, from where they can be committed and pushed.

**Note:** When exporting config, check for language switches or overwriting customized configuration (such as standard Drupal emails changed through core updates).

### Code Quality Tools

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality and ensure adherence to Drupal coding standards:

#### PHP Code Sniffer (PHPCS)

PHPCS is used to check PHP code against the Drupal coding standards. To check your code:

```sh
./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=Drupal webroot/modules/custom
```

#### PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer (PHPCBF)

PHPCBF can automatically fix many coding standard violations detected by PHPCS. To auto-fix your code:

```sh
./vendor/bin/phpcbf --standard=Drupal webroot/modules/custom
```

#### Drupal Check

Drupal Check is used to identify deprecated code usage and other potential issues:

```sh
./vendor/bin/drupal-check webroot/modules/custom
```

Running these tools regularly helps maintain code quality and prevents issues from accumulating over time.

## Custom Modules

The SAHO project includes several custom modules that provide specific functionality tailored to the site's needs. These modules are located in `/webroot/modules/custom/`.

### Module Architecture

Our custom modules follow Drupal's standard module structure and coding standards:

- **Naming Convention**: All custom modules are prefixed with `saho_` to distinguish them from contributed modules
- **Service-Oriented**: Modules utilize Drupal's service container for dependency injection

### Radix and "saho" Subtheme
The SAHO website uses the Radix theme as the base, with a custom subtheme named "saho." The Radix theme allows for the use of components, which makes it easy to maintain consistency across the website.

For detailed information on Radix, you can visit [Radix Documentation](https://radix.trydrupal.com/radix/working-with-the-components/components-intro).

### Theme Architecture

The SAHO theme follows a modern, component-based architecture built on top of Radix and Bootstrap 5:

#### Directory Structure
```
webroot/themes/custom/saho/
âââ components/          # Radix components with Twig templates
âââ src/                 # Source files for compilation
â   âââ scss/           # SCSS source files
â   â   âââ base/       # Base styles and utilities
â   â   âââ components/ # Component-specific styles
â   âââ js/             # JavaScript source files
âââ css/                # Additional compiled CSS
âââ js/                 # Additional JavaScript files
âââ templates/          # Drupal template overrides
âââ includes/           # Theme hooks and preprocessing
```

### Component Development

Components in the SAHO theme are self-contained units that include:
- **Twig template** (`.twig`): HTML structure
- **SCSS file** (`.scss`): Component styles
- **Component definition** (`.component.yml`): Metadata and properties
- **README** (`.mdx`): Documentation

#### Available Components
- **block**: Standard content blocks with consistent styling
- **carousel**: Image and content carousels
- **navbar**: Main navigation with responsive behavior
- **page-footer**: Site footer with social links
- **page-navigation**: Breadcrumbs and local navigation
- **local-tasks**: Admin tabs and actions

### Styling Guidelines

#### SCSS Architecture
The theme uses a structured SCSS approach:

1. **Base Styles** (`src/scss/base/`):
   - `_variables.scss`: Theme colors, spacing, typography
   - `_mixins.scss`: Reusable style patterns
   - `_typography.scss`: Font definitions and text styles
   - `_utilities.scss`: Helper classes
   - `_featured-biography.scss`: Biography-specific styles
   - `_tdih-interactive.scss`: This Day in History styles

2. **Component Styles** (`src/scss/components/`):
   - `_unified-cards.scss`: Consistent card layouts
   - `_glass-card.scss`: Modern glass-morphism effects
   - `_hover-effects.scss`: Interactive hover states
   - `_search-results.scss`: Search result styling
   - `_context-sections.scss`: Contextual content areas

3. **Additional Styles** (`css/`):
   - `modern-modals.css`: Modal dialog enhancements
   - `sidebar-accordion.css`: Collapsible sidebar elements
   - `biography-metadata.css`: Biography-specific metadata display
   - `url-truncation.css`: Smart URL display truncation

#### CSS Best Practices
- Use BEM naming convention for classes
- Leverage Bootstrap 5 utilities where appropriate
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
- Minimize specificity to ease overrides

#### JavaScript Architecture
JavaScript files follow Drupal behaviors pattern:

1. **Core Scripts** (`src/js/`):
   - `main.script.js`: Primary theme JavaScript
   - `search-enhancements.js`: Search UX improvements
   - `mobile-enhancements.js`: Mobile-specific features
   - `advanced-search.js`: Advanced search functionality

2. **Bootstrap Integration**:
   - Custom Bootstrap 5 configuration
   - Toast notifications
   - Tooltip initialization

3. **Interactive Features** (`js/`):
   - `sidebar-accordion.js`: Accordion functionality
   - `sidebar-tabs.js`: Tab navigation
   - `url-truncation.js`: Dynamic URL truncation

### Build Process

The theme uses Laravel Mix (Webpack) for asset compilation:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   cd webroot/themes/custom/saho
   npm install
   ```

2. **Development Build** (with source maps):
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Production Build** (minified):
   ```sh
   npm run production
   ```

4. **Watch Mode** (auto-compile on changes):
   ```sh
   npm run watch
   ```

5. **Code Quality** (Biome linting):
   ```sh
   npm run biome:check
   npm run biome:fix
   ```

### Theme Configuration

- **Libraries** (`saho.libraries.yml`): Defines CSS/JS assets
- **Breakpoints** (`saho.breakpoints.yml`): Responsive breakpoints
- **Theme Settings** (`saho.info.yml`): Theme metadata and regions
- **Block Configuration** (`config/optional/`): Default block placement

### Template Overrides

The theme provides extensive template overrides organized by type:
- **Content**: Node displays for articles, biographies, events
- **Blocks**: Custom block templates
- **Forms**: Search forms and exposed filters
- **Views**: Landing pages, archives, search results
- **Navigation**: Menus, breadcrumbs, pagers

#### Working with the "saho" Subtheme
- The "saho" subtheme builds upon Radix's component-based architecture.
- When developing components, use the `components/` directory within the "saho" subtheme for better organization.
- Use Radix's built-in tools for consistent styling and JS integration.
- Theming is done by extending Radix templates within the "saho" theme directory, which keeps the customizations modular and easy to maintain.
- SCSS files are used to create styles, and they are compiled using Node.js. Ensure you run `npm install` in the theme directory to get the required dependencies.

## Using the Drupal Radix CLI with DDEV

The following steps will help you use the `drupal-radix-cli` command within a DDEV environment for managing Radix themes.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **List Available Components**
   To use the Radix CLI we have to enter our Drupal container within DDEV, run:
   ```sh
   ddev ssh
   ```
   You are now in your Drupal and you can use the radix CLI:
   ```sh
   cd webroot/themes/contrib/radix
   ```

2. **List Available Components**
   To list all components available in your Radix theme, run:
   ```sh
   drupal-radix-cli list
   ```

3. **Add a Radix Component**
   To add a Radix component to your current theme, use:
   ```sh
   drupal-radix-cli add
   ```
   Use the `--radix-path` flag to specify a custom Radix components directory if your Radix base theme is installed in a non-standard location:
   ```sh
   drupal-radix-cli add --radix-path ../../radix/components
   ```

4. **Generate a New Component**
   To generate a clean new component folder within your subtheme components directory:
   ```sh
   drupal-radix-cli generate
   ```
   This will generate a new component folder with the following files:
   - `[component-name]/[component-name].twig`
   - `[component-name]/[component-name].component.yml`
   - `[component-name]/[component-name].scss`
   - `[component-name]/_[component-name].js`
   - `[component-name]/README.md`

   Make sure to remove any unwanted files and update your files accordingly.

5. **Help**
   To display usage instructions:
   ```sh
   drupal-radix-cli --help
   ```
   Or simply run:
   ```sh
   drupal-radix-cli
   ```

The `drupal-radix-cli` provides various commands to help manage and work with Radix themes effectively. You can explore more commands and options by referring to the [official Radix documentation](https://radix.trydrupal.com/radix/working-with-the-components/the-drupal-radix-cli).

### Git Strategy & Collaboration
We use Git to facilitate collaboration and versioning of our code. Our Git strategy aims to keep things lean and straightforward, allowing for a dynamic workflow suitable for the size of the project and developer team.

#### Branch Naming Convention and Commit Messages
Branch naming follows Gitflow conventions with Novicell customizations:
- Branch names should include the issue tag (example: `SAHO-50`):
  ```
  SAHO-50--example-commit-message
  ```

#### Trunk-Based Development & Rebase
Trunk-based development is a version control management practice where developers merge small, frequent updates to a core "trunk" or master branch, helping achieve CI/CD and enhancing software delivery and team performance. You can learn more about [trunk-based development here](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development).

##### Rebase in Developer Workflow
Here's an example workflow for using Git in this project:
1. Pull the latest changes from the master branch:
   ```sh
   git pull --rebase origin master
   ```
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```sh
   git switch -c my-awesome-feature-branch
   ```
3. Make changes and commit often:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
   ```sh
   git commit -m "My awesome comment"
   ```
4. Periodically rebase your work onto the master branch to incorporate recent changes:
   ```sh
   git checkout master
   ```
   ```sh
   git pull --rebase origin master
   ```
5. Rebase your feature branch onto the updated master branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout feature/my-awesome-feature-branch
   ```
   ```sh
   git rebase master
   ```
6. Push your branch to the remote repository:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature-branch --force
   ```

**Note:** Always use the `--force` flag to overwrite the remote branch history when necessary. Avoid merging master into your feature branch; instead, rebase to keep the commit history clean.

#### Pull Requests & Reviews
New features should be submitted as Pull Requests (PRs) and reviewed by other developers on the team. A good PR process includes:
- Locally building the project with the new feature.
- Testing the new feature locally.
- Creating a PR including a list of added/removed features.
- Providing a short guide on how to test the feature for the reviewer.
- Communicating if the PR is blocked by another PR, decision, or action.

#### Best Practices for Collaboration
- Use only fast-forward merges to the trunk.
- Use Pull Requests for merges to engage team members (master branch is protected).
- Squash multiple commits into one for a cleaner history.
- Rebase master against your short-lived branches, but do not merge master into them.
- Feature branches should be short-lived (ideally max. two working days).
- Keep commit messages concise and always include the case number.
- Never commit secrets of any kind to the repository.
- Use the `--sort-packages` flag with Composer for better dependency management.

Let's keep the repository clean and delete old feature branches when they are no longer needed.

[![PR Build and Test](https://github.com/South-African-History-Online/sahistory-web/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/South-African-History-Online/sahistory-web/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This project leverages a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure high code quality and streamline the development process. Our automated workflows help catch issues early and maintain a consistent codebase.

#### â¨ Benefits of Our CI/CD Pipeline

- **Catch Issues Early**: Identify and fix problems before they reach production
- **Consistent Quality**: Enforce coding standards across all contributions
- **Faster Development**: Automate repetitive tasks like testing and building
- **Reliable Deployments**: Ensure only working code gets deployed
- **Better Collaboration**: Provide immediate feedback on pull requests

#### ð What the Pipeline Checks

- **JavaScript Linting** â¡: Uses Biome to enforce code style and catch potential errors
- **SCSS Compilation** ð¨: Ensures that SCSS files compile correctly
- **Asset Building** ð¦: Builds and optimizes frontend assets
- **PHP Coding Standards** ð: Verifies PHP code follows Drupal coding standards
- **Drupal Best Practices** ð§: Checks for Drupal-specific issues and recommendations
- **Composer Validation** ðµ: Ensures Composer configuration is valid

#### ð ï¸ How to Ensure the Pipeline Passes

Before pushing your changes, run these checks locally:

```sh
# For frontend changes
cd webroot/themes/custom/saho
npm run biome:check
npm run production

# For PHP/Drupal changes
composer validate --strict
./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=Drupal webroot/modules/custom
./vendor/bin/drupal-check webroot/modules/custom
```

The pipeline status is displayed at the top of this README and on each pull request. Green means everything is working correctly! ð¢

##### Useless Incrementor
This is a simple counter that can be incremented to trigger the CI/CD pipeline for testing purposes. When you need to trigger a build without making any meaningful changes to the codebase, simply increment this number and commit the change.
